 <b>Hello learners,</b> before learning about Git lets know Some Basics which helps in better understanding.

In simple words Git is a CLI(Command Line Interface) tool to communicate with Github from local system/machine.  

<b>What is Command?</b>
            A command is an instruction given by a user telling a 'TERMINAL' to do something, such a run a single program or a group of linked programs. Commands are generally issued by typing them in at the command line (i.e., the all-text display mode)and then pressing the ENTER key, which passes them to the 'SHELL'.

<b>What is TERMINAL and SHELL?</b>
           A shell is the program that the terminal sends user input. The shell generates output and passes it back to the terminal for display.

<b>What is Version Control?</b> 
Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later when ever required. 

<b>Centralized Version Control Systems:</b>
These systems have a single server which acts as a central storage(repository) for all the versioned files so as all the developers can checkout files from that central place.

											

<b>Distributed Version Control Systems:</b>
These system have a single server which acts as a central storage and all the developers will have a copy in local with all the versioned files.
there by developer can work without relying on server during the  code development.
										


<b>Definition:</b>
         Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

<B>Windows users:</b> download > Git bash > to run the git commands locally.
<i><b>Linux/ macOS:</b></i> no need to download. use terminal to run the bash commands.
